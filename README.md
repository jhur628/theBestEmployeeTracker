# theBestEmployeeTracker

## Description
I made the Best Employee Tracker.

When the user types in node index.js on their terminal, the user will be presented with options.

The user may view different tables by choosing the option with "View". The user can view a table for all departments, roles, and employees.

The user may add values to the tables by using the "Add" options. The can add a department, role, or employee to their respective tables. The user just needs to follow the prompts, add their desired values will be added to the tables.

The user can update an employee's role with the "Update and employee role" option. The user will be asked which employee they want to change roles for. The user will then be asked which role the employee will be changing into. Then, the employee's role change can viewed in the "View all employees" option.

When the user chooses the "Exit" option, the app will end and the user will be taken back into the terminal.

Thank you and enjoy!
